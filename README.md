- **Anyone** who wants to interact with Bitbucket using natural language

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 2 minutes:

### 1. Get Your Bitbucket Credentials

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Bitbucket App Passwords are being deprecated and will be removed by **June 2026**. We recommend using **Scoped API Tokens** for new setups.

#### Option A: Scoped API Token (Recommended - Future-Proof)

**Bitbucket is deprecating app passwords**. Use the new scoped API tokens instead:

1. Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **"Create API token with scopes"**
3. Select **"Bitbucket"** as the product
4. Choose the appropriate scopes:
   - **For read-only access**: `repository`, `workspace`
   - **For full functionality**: `repository`, `workspace`, `pullrequest`
5. Copy the generated token (starts with `ATATT`)
6. Use with your Atlassian email as the username

#### Option B: App Password (Legacy - Will be deprecated)

Generate a Bitbucket App Password (legacy method):
1. Go to [Bitbucket App Passwords](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)
2. Click "Create app password"
3. Give it a name like "AI Assistant"
4. Select these permissions:
   - **Workspaces**: Read
   - **Repositories**: Read (and Write if you want AI to create PRs/comments)
   - **Pull Requests**: Read (and Write for PR management)

### 2. Try It Instantly

```bash
# Set your credentials
export ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL="your.email@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your_scoped_api_token"  # Token starting with ATATT

# List your workspaces
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket ls-workspaces

# List repositories in your workspace
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket ls-repos --workspace-slug your-workspace

# Get details about a specific repository  
npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket get-repo --workspace-slug your-workspace --repo-slug your-repo
```

## Connect to AI Assistants

### For Claude Desktop Users

Add this to your Claude configuration file (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bitbucket": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket"],
      "env": {
        "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
        "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_scoped_api_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop, and you'll see "🔗 bitbucket" in the status bar.

### For Other AI Assistants

Most AI assistants support MCP. Install the server globally:

```bash
npm install -g @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket
```

Then configure your AI assistant to use the MCP server with STDIO transport.

### Alternative: Configuration File

Create `~/.mcp/configs.json` for system-wide configuration:

```json
{
  "bitbucket": {
    "environments": {
      "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
      "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_scoped_api_token",
      "BITBUCKET_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE": "your_main_workspace"
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative config keys:** The system also accepts `"atlassian-bitbucket"`, `"@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket"`, or `"mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket"` instead of `"bitbucket"`.

## Real-World Examples

### 🔍 Explore Your Repositories

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"List all repositories in my main workspace"*
- *"Show me details about the backend-api repository"*
- *"What's the commit history for the feature-auth branch?"*
- *"Get the content of src/config.js from the main branch"*

### 📋 Manage Pull Requests

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Show me all open pull requests that need review"*
- *"Get details about pull request #42 including the code changes"*
- *"Create a pull request from feature-login to main branch"*
- *"Add a comment to PR #15 saying the tests passed"*
- *"Approve pull request #33"*

### 🔧 Work with Branches and Code

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Compare my feature branch with the main branch"*
- *"Create a new branch called hotfix-login from the main branch"*
- *"List all branches in the user-service repository"*
- *"Show me the differences between commits abc123 and def456"*

### 🔎 Search and Discovery

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Search for JavaScript files that contain 'authentication'"*
- *"Find all pull requests related to the login feature"*
- *"Search for repositories in the mobile project"*
- *"Show me code files that use the React framework"*

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" or "403 Forbidden"

1. **Choose the right authentication method**:
   - **Standard Atlassian method**: Use your Atlassian account email + API token (works with any Atlassian service)
   - **Bitbucket-specific method**: Use your Bitbucket username + App password (Bitbucket only)

2. **For Bitbucket App Passwords** (if using Option 2):
   - Go to [Bitbucket App Passwords](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/)
   - Make sure your app password has the right permissions (Workspaces: Read, Repositories: Read, Pull Requests: Read)

3. **For Scoped API Tokens** (recommended):
   - Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   - Make sure your token is still active and has the right scopes
   - Update your `~/.mcp/configs.json` file to use the new scoped API token format:
   ```json
   {
     "@aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket": {
       "environments": {
         "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
         "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "ATATT3xFfGF0..."
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Verify your credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Test your credentials work
   npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket ls-workspaces
   ```

### "Workspace not found" or "Repository not found"

1. **Check your workspace slug**:
   ```bash
   # List your workspaces to see the correct slugs
   npx -y @aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-bitbucket ls-workspaces
   ```

2. **Use the exact slug from Bitbucket URL**:
   - If your repo URL is `https://bitbucket.org/myteam/my-repo`
   - Workspace slug is `myteam`
   - Repository slug is `my-repo`

### "No default workspace configured"

Set a default workspace to avoid specifying it every time:
```bash
export BITBUCKET_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE="your-main-workspace-slug"
```

### Claude Desktop Integration Issues

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** after updating the config file
2. **Check the status bar** for the "🔗 bitbucket" indicator
3. **Verify config file location**:
   - macOS: `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What permissions do I need?

**For Scoped API Tokens** (recommended):
- Your regular Atlassian account with access to Bitbucket
- Scoped API token created at [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
- Required scopes: `repository`, `workspace` (add `pullrequest` for PR management)

**For Bitbucket App Passwords** (legacy - being deprecated):
- For **read-only access** (viewing repos, PRs, commits):
  - Workspaces: Read
  - Repositories: Read  
  - Pull Requests: Read
- For **full functionality** (creating PRs, commenting):
  - Add "Write" permissions for Repositories and Pull Requests

### Can I use this with private repositories?

Yes! This works with both public and private repositories. You just need the appropriate permissions through your Bitbucket App Password.

### Do I need to specify workspace every time?

No! Set `BITBUCKET_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` in your environment or config file, and it will be used automatically when you don't specify one.

### What AI assistants does this work with?

Any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP):
- Claude Desktop (most popular)
- Cursor AI
- Continue.dev
- Many others

### Is my data secure?

Yes! This tool:
- Runs entirely on your local machine
- Uses your own Bitbucket credentials
- Never sends your data to third parties
- Only accesses what you give it permission to access

### Can I use this for multiple Bitbucket accounts?

Currently, each installation supports one set of credentials. For multiple accounts, you'd need separate configurations.
